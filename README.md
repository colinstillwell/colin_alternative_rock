Follow the instructions in the `spotify_artist` module [README](https://github.com/colinstillwell/colin_alternative_rock/blob/master/web/modules/custom/spotify_artist/README.md)

## Notes

This section highlights key technical decisions made during development.

#### Spotify API: Data Fetching Approach

Fetching data from an external API requires balancing performance, reliability, and user experience. After evaluating multiple approaches, I identified these as the top three most practical options for handling API data efficiently.

##### Option 1 - Fetch Data on Page Load

This approach retrieves artist data directly from the API every time the page loads. It ensures real-time updates but slows down page loads, increases dependency on an external service, and fails if the API is unavailable.

##### Option 2 - Cached API Responses

Data is temporarily stored to reduce frequent API requests. This lowers the number of calls while keeping data relatively fresh, but cached data can expire unexpectedly, causing occasional delays when refetching.

##### Option 3 - Store Data in Entity (Chosen Approach)

Artist data is fetched once when the entity is created and stored for future use. This ensures fast page loads, works offline, and provides a predictable user experience. However, data may become outdated over time.

##### Conclusion

Fetching data on page load provides real-time updates but introduces performance and reliability issues. By storing artist data in an entity, the project ensures fast page loads, resilience to API failures, and full control over when updates occur. Given more time, I would introduce an automated update mechanism, such as refreshing data if it hasn‚Äôt been updated recently or running scheduled updates via a cron job, to keep artist information more up to date.

#### Spotify API: Policy

On the [Web API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-artist), Spotify outlines important policy guidelines for developers integrating with their service.

##### Spotify content may not be downloaded

As covered in [Spotify API: Data Fetching Approach](#spotify-api-data-fetching-approach), I store artist metadata in a custom entity to improve performance and reduce reliance on live API requests. While this technically involves persisting Spotify data, it can be periodically refreshed, ensuring it remains accurate and aligned with API expectations. With more time, I would implement a cron job to handle these updates automatically.

For artist images, I initially rendered them directly using the Spotify image URLs but opted to use [Imagecache External](https://www.drupal.org/project/imagecache_external) to apply Drupal image styles. While this results in temporary local storage, a cron job could be introduced to periodically clear and refresh cached images, ensuring compliance with Spotify‚Äôs intent. If needed, switching back to direct Spotify image URLs would be a simple adjustment.

##### Keep visual content in its original form

I made minor modifications to artist images, such as applying a circular mask, to demonstrate theming within a module rather than a theme. This could easily be reverted to ensure strict compliance if necessary.

##### Ensure content attribution

Each artist‚Äôs page includes a direct link to their official Spotify profile, ensuring proper attribution. However, the styling of this link could be refined to better adhere to Spotify‚Äôs [Design & Brand Guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design#using-our-content).

#### Ordering

I decided to order the Spotify Artists based on popularity, then followers, then name. Since the task is open-ended in some areas, I chose this ordering based on what I felt provided the best user experience. I did consider adding an ordering mechanism where administrators could manually define the sort order, but the extra time required did not feel appropriate.

#### Path Alias

Currently, Spotify Artists have canonical URLs in the format:
`/spotify-artist/{spotify_artist}`, where `{spotify_artist}` is the entity ID.

I considered using either the Spotify ID or an aliased page title instead. Given the open-ended nature of the task, I retained the default path structure rather than implementing a custom aliasing system. Implementing a more user-friendly aliasing system would require additional time, which did not feel appropriate.

#### Profile

The Spotify Showcase profile (`spotify_showcase`) is a custom installation profile that preconfigures the site with essential modules, settings, and configurations. It streamlines the installation process, ensuring the project is ready to use straight from the quick start.

#### Theming

For this project, I selected Radix, a component-based Drupal theme that includes Bootstrap 5, Sass, ES6, BrowserSync, and BiomeJS out of the box. I didn‚Äôt spend long choosing a base theme, as many options are available.

To allow for future custom styling, I created a sub-theme (`spotify`) using a Radix starter kit. This approach ensures flexibility for modifications while keeping the base theme updatable.

The Spotify Artist module includes minimal styling to demonstrate my understanding of Drupal theming, focusing on layout rather than extensive customisation.

#### Recipes

I explored Drupal Recipes but chose an installation profile (`spotify_showcase`) instead. Profiles run during site install, making them better for setting up a new project from scratch, while recipes are more suited for post-install changes.

#### Coding Standards

The `colin_alternative_rock.code-workspace` file contains Visual Studio Code settings and recommended extensions to enforce Drupal coding standards. These settings are loosely based on [Drupal.org‚Äôs official standards](https://www.drupal.org/node/2918206), and demonstrate my understanding of best practices.

I am aware that some of these settings would typically be configured per-user. I also have experience configuring this setup for PhpStorm, another widely used Drupal IDE.

Additionally, this project includes PHPStan for static analysis and PHPCS for enforcing Drupal coding standards. Both tools are pre-configured in .phpstan.neon.dist and .phpcs.xml.dist, ensuring consistency with Drupal‚Äôs best practices.

To further enforce these standards, Husky is used to run automated checks before commits, preventing coding standard violations from entering the repository.

Files in the root directory, such as Node packages and dotfiles, help support this setup.

#### Conventional Commits

This repository uses Conventional Commits to maintain a structured commit history, enabling automated release notes and changelogs.

##### Getting Started

Ensure you have ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)) installed, then run:

```shell
nvm install
npm install
```

##### Optional

When running `git commit`, it will often:

- Start the Commitizen prompt, but forget your original commit message, and
- Sometimes open your editor after the prompt finishes, asking you to re-confirm or rewrite the message.

To avoid this confusion and make the commit process smoother, you can use `git cz` as a shortcut:

```shell
git config --local alias.cz '!npx cz'
```
