## Notes

This section highlights key technical decisions made during development.

### Conventional Commits

All commits in this project are prefixed with [master]. This is because I have globally configured Conventional Commits to integrate with Jira. If no ticket ID is provided (as in this case), the prefix defaults to the name of the branch I am working on.

Conventional Commits help automate the creation of release notes, providing a structured approach to commit history.

### Coding Standards

The `colin_alternative_rock.code-workspace` file contains Visual Studio Code settings and recommended extensions to enforce Drupal coding standards. These settings are loosely based on [Drupal.org‚Äôs official standards](https://www.drupal.org/node/2918206) and demonstrate my understanding of best practices.

I am aware that some of these settings would typically be configured per-user. I also have experience configuring this setup for PhpStorm, another widely used Drupal IDE.

Additionally, files in the root directory, such as Node packages and dotfiles, help support this.

### Recipes

I explored Drupal Recipes but chose an installation profile (spotify_showcase) instead. Profiles run during site install, making them better for setting up a new project from scratch, while recipes are more suited for post-install changes.

### Profile

The Spotify Showcase profile (spotify_showcase) is a custom installation profile that preconfigures the site with essential modules, settings and configurations. It streamlines the installation process, ensuring the project is ready to use straight from the quick start.
