## Notes

This section highlights key technical decisions made during development.

### Recipes

I explored Drupal Recipes but chose an installation profile (spotify_showcase) instead. Profiles run during site install, making them better for setting up a new project from scratch, while recipes are more suited for post-install changes.

### Profile

The Spotify Showcase profile (spotify_showcase) is a custom installation profile that preconfigures the site with essential modules, settings and configurations. It streamlines the installation process, ensuring the project is ready to use straight from the quick start.
